Welcome to the source file repository for the [Dapr website](https://dapr.io). The website is a simple static site, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/daprio/settings/general).

---

## Structure:
Important folders and files to note:

[/data/homepage.yml](https://github.com/dapr/website/blob/master/data/homepage.yml) - Dynamic content such as text.  This is the only file you need to touch when looking for minor modifications such as changing text, adding a pane in a section or replacing and image.

[/styleguides/](https://github.com/dapr/website/tree/master/styleguides) - Latest brand assets and logos for Dapr

[/static/images/](https://github.com/dapr/website/tree/master/static/images) - All image file in the site

[/config.toml](https://github.com/dapr/website/blob/master/config.toml) - Hugo configuration and parameters including baseURL, headers and footers, Google Analytics etc.

[/netlify.toml](https://github.com/dapr/website/blob/master/netlify.toml) - Configuration for deployment on Netlify

[/themes/bigspring/](https://github.com/dapr/website/blob/master/themes/bigspring) - The website theme

[/themes/bigspring/layouts/index.html](https://github.com/dapr/website/blob/master/themes/bigspring/layouts/index.html) - The main HTML file which includes most of the structure of the website

[/themes/bigspring/assets/scss/_variables.scss](https://github.com/dapr/website/blob/master/themes/bigspring/assets/scss/_variables.scss) - Definitions of colors etc.

## Development
### Run locally
Make sure you have [Hugo installed](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing)

Run:

```bash
hugo server --disableFastRender
```

### Editing the content
All basic content editing can be done via changes to [/data/homepage.yml](https://github.com/dapr/website/blob/master/data/homepage.yml). Note that the different sections in the file are ordered in the same way as in the website. Each section will usually have an `enable` flag which allows it to be removed without deleting it from the file.

One exception is the menus in the header and footer of the website which are defined in [/config.toml](https://github.com/dapr/website/blob/master/config.toml)

Image assets are stored at [/static/images](https://github.com/dapr/website/tree/master/static/images)

### Editing the theme
The website uses a modified [Bigspring theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/bigspring-hugo-startup-theme/). You can find the documentation for the original theme [here](https://docs.gethugothemes.com/bigspring/).

All theme files are found at [/themes/bigspring](https://github.com/dapr/website/blob/master/themes/bigspring). Most likely changes you will be looking to do are to the main index file [/themes/bigspring/layouts/index.html](https://github.com/dapr/website/blob/master/themes/bigspring/layouts/index.html) this file uses content (like text and image file names) from [/data/homepage.yml](https://github.com/dapr/website/blob/master/data/homepage.yml)

## Deployment

The site is automatically rebuilt on Netlify when changes are merged into `master` branch. You view build logs by clicking on the badge below:
