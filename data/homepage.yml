  title : "Build distributed applications faster"
  content : "Dapr is a set of integrated APIs with built-in best practices and patterns to build distributed applications. Dapr increases your developer productivity by 20-40% with out-of-the-box features such as workflow, pub/sub, state management, secret stores, external configuration, bindings, actors, distributed lock, and cryptography. You benefit from the built-in security, reliability, and observability capabilities, so you don't need to write boilerplate code to achieve production-ready applications."

      content2 : "Take advantage of workflow patterns such as task chaining, fan-out/fan-in, monitor, timers, and external system interaction. Combine Dapr workflow with the Dapr APIs to send messages, invoke services, and store key/value data. Workflow state can be stored in any database of your choice."

      video : "images/2_best_practices.mp4"
      content : "Dapr includes built-in security features that are \"on by default\". Developers and ops can set application-centric policies on APIs, services, and components to limit access without getting into low level networking concerns.  Communication is automatically encrypted in-transit with mTLS."
      content2 : "Dapr also provides resiliency policies to protect against failures due to any number of issues, including hardware failures, unexpected throughput, or application lifecycle events, such as scaling out and application restarts. Dapr provides specific capabilities that detect failures and enable configurable retries, back-offs, circuit breakers and timeouts."

    - name : "Integrate with the infrastructure of your choice"
      image : "images/3_integrate.gif"
      video : "images/3_integrate.mp4"
      content : "Dapr's component model decouples the integrated API with the underlying resources. For instance, when you're using the Dapr publish subscribe API, you can change the message broker by swapping out a yaml component file to switch from RabbitMQ, to Kafka (or any other supported broker), without changing your application code."
      content2: "Dapr applications run on Kubernetes or run self-hosted on any virtual or physical machine, so you can run Dapr applications on any cloud or edge."
